# E11b-First-Person

I added a collision shape for a character accompanied with a camera near the top for first person view. I also added a script for rotation and movement as well as a weapon mesh to attatch to the character. For some reason I can't get rotation to work now? He moves fine but I put down everything he did in the video and it didn't work so I went to the webste and tries using that set of instructions and same deal. You can check my code it should be all the same so I'm confused on why it doesn't work. Otherwise he moves perfectly fine. I'm actually sumped.

Edit: I was able to figure it out. I'm resubmitting the actual fully working version.
